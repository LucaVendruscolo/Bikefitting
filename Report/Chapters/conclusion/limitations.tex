\subsection{Discussion of Limitations}
\label{subsec:limitation}
Most state-of-the-art bike-fitting applications take exact measurements of ankle flexion to understand the entire drive dynamic. Due to the difficulty in measuring the ankle position using our technique, we must use a heuristic derived from crank position, which may result in imperfect measurements. Additionally, we do not require data quality checks from user inputs, such that poor video can result in limited recommendation confidence.
