\subsection{Summary}
\label{subsec:summary}
We find that video-based bike-fitting methods can effectively give a recommendation to raise or lower the seat post using a Holmes seat adjustment method. Further, our model provides feedback in near real time from any camera-enabled device with reasonable computational overhead. While we do not recommend our model to be used for racing or aerodynamic optimization, the product can improve the fit for a user's bike at effectively no cost.
