\subsection{Overview of the Project}
\label{subsec:overview}
We aim to provide a robust recommendation framework for seat post height adjustments from a 2D video of a human rider on a bicycle. In the first step, we clip the video to include only our target bicycle and rider. Next, we detect human joints of the rider and bicycle wheels. From these segmentations, we estimate the yaw of the bicycle using a custom model and use that measurement to inform our estimate of human joint angles. These upper joint angles (knee, hip, elbow) are overlaid into the drivetrain cycle, calculated from the relative ankle locations, providing the necessary data to provide an informed saddle adjustment. Further optional additions include data pipeline modification to improve the crankshaft angle detection. Additionally, we deploy our model on a website such that users can upload their own videos at \hyperlink{https://bikefitting.vercel.app/}{https://bikefitting.vercel.app/}.
